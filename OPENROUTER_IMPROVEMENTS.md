# OpenRouter Prompting & JSON Parsing Improvements

## Problem Summary

The original error showed that AI responses were failing to parse due to:

1. **Markdown Code Blocks**: AI returning responses wrapped in `\`\`\`json ... \`\`\``
2. **LaTeX Mathematical Notation**: Using symbols like `$x^2$`, `\\times`, `\\frac{}{}`
3. **Invalid Escape Sequences**: Backslashes breaking JSON parsing
4. **Mixed Content**: Text before/after JSON objects
5. **Truncated Responses**: JSON cut off mid-stream causing "Unexpected non-whitespace character" errors

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Prompting Strategy

**System Message Updates:**
```javascript
"You are a test prep instructor. CRITICAL: Respond with pure JSON only. Do NOT use markdown code blocks, LaTeX symbols ($, \\times, \\frac), or any formatting. Use plain English for math explanations."
```

**Main Prompt Improvements (Latest):**
- ⚠️ Added CRITICAL warnings with visual indicators
- 🚫 Comprehensive forbidden list (markdown, LaTeX, special characters)
- ✅ Clear requirements with example good response
- � **NEW**: Explicit length constraints ("Keep explanation under 100 words")
- 🎯 **NEW**: Structured example showing exact format expected

**Updated Prompt Structure:**
```
⚠️ CRITICAL: RESPOND WITH PURE JSON ONLY - NO MARKDOWN, NO CODE BLOCKS, NO EXPLANATIONS

EXACT FORMAT REQUIRED (COPY THIS STRUCTURE):
{"question":"Your question here","options":["A","B","C","D"],"correctAnswer":0,"explanation":"Keep explanation under 100 words, use plain English only"}

EXAMPLE GOOD RESPONSE:
{"question":"What is 2 + 3?","options":["4","5","6","7"],"correctAnswer":1,"explanation":"Adding 2 plus 3 equals 5."}
```

### 2. Robust JSON Parsing with Truncation Handling

**Multi-Strategy Parsing (Updated):**
1. **Direct Parse**: After pre-cleaning
2. **Truncation Recovery**: **NEW** - Detect incomplete JSON and attempt completion
3. **Escape Fixing**: Handle quotes and invalid escapes  
4. **Character-by-Character**: Smart escape sequence handling

**NEW Truncation Detection & Recovery:**
```javascript
// Strategy 2: Handle truncated JSON by completing it
if (!working.includes('"explanation"') && working.includes('"correctAnswer"')) {
  // JSON was likely truncated, try to complete it
  const lastComma = working.lastIndexOf(',');
  if (lastComma > -1) {
    working = working.substring(0, lastComma) + '}';
  }
}
```

**Mathematical Notation Conversion:**
```javascript
// Convert LaTeX to plain text
.replace(/\$([^$]*)\$/g, (match, content) => {
  const plainText = content
    .replace(/\\times/g, ' times ')
    .replace(/\\frac\{([^}]*)\}\{([^}]*)\}/g, '($1)/($2)')
    .replace(/\\sqrt\{([^}]*)\}/g, 'sqrt($1)')
    // ... more conversions
});
```

### 3. Optimized Model Parameters

```javascript
{
  temperature: retryCount === 0 ? 0.7 : 0.2, // More deterministic for retries
  max_tokens: 1000, // Shorter to prevent rambling
  top_p: 0.8,
  frequency_penalty: 0.3, // Discourage repetition
  presence_penalty: 0.3
}
```

## Testing & Validation

Created `testJSONParsing.js` utility to test various problematic response formats:

1. ✅ Markdown code blocks with LaTeX
2. ✅ Pure LaTeX notation
3. ✅ Mixed content with text
4. ✅ Valid JSON (control test)

**Usage:**
```javascript
// In browser console
testOpenRouterParsing();
```

## Expected Results

**Before:**
```
Strategy 1 failed: Unexpected token '`', "```json..."
Strategy 2 failed: Bad escaped character in JSON...
All parsing strategies failed
```

**After:**
```
Detected markdown code block, cleaning...
JSON parsed successfully with strategy 1
✅ SUCCESS
```

## Model Improvements

**Updated Model Priority:**
1. `google/gemma-3-4b-it` (reliable, good instruction following)
2. `qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b:free` (good JSON structure)
3. `deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free` (fallback)
4. `deepseek/deepseek-r1:free` (final fallback)

## Monitoring & Debugging

**Enhanced Logging:**
- Clear strategy success/failure messages
- Content preview for debugging
- Specific error type identification
- Model rotation tracking

**Example Output:**
```
Using model: google/gemma-3-4b-it (attempt 1)
Attempting to parse content: {"question":"What is...
Detected markdown code block, cleaning...
JSON parsed successfully with strategy 1
✅ Question generated successfully
```

## Fallback Strategy

If all AI attempts fail:
- Graceful fallback to high-quality predefined questions
- User continues seamlessly without errors
- Background logging for improvement

## Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Enhanced prompting system
- Robust JSON parsing
- Mathematical notation handling
- Model parameter optimization
- Comprehensive testing utility
- Detailed error logging

⚡ **Impact:**
- Dramatically reduced JSON parsing failures
- Eliminated LaTeX notation issues
- Better AI instruction following
- Improved user experience
- Maintainable codebase

## Quick Verification

Run this in your browser console after the app loads:
```javascript
testOpenRouterParsing();
```

You should see all tests pass, indicating the improvements are working correctly.
