                passage:
                    "The concept of artificial intelligence has evolved dramatically since its inception in the 1950s. Early researchers were optimistic about creating machines that could think and reason like humans within a few decades. However, the complexity of human cognition proved far greater than initially anticipated. While modern AI systems excel at specific tasks like chess, image recognition, and language translation, they still lack the general intelligence and adaptability that characterizes human thinking. Recent advances in machine learning and neural networks have renewed interest in artificial general intelligence, though experts remain divided on whether and when such systems might be achieved.",
                question:
                    "According to the passage, what can be inferred about early AI researchers?",

                passage:
                    "Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges of our time, with far-reaching implications for ecosystems, human societies, and economic systems worldwide. The scientific consensus overwhelmingly supports the conclusion that human activities, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from fossil fuel combustion, are the primary drivers of recent climate change. Evidence for this warming trend includes rising global temperatures, melting ice sheets, rising sea levels, and shifting precipitation patterns. However, the complexity of climate systems means that impacts vary significantly by geographic region and time scale. Some areas may experience more severe droughts, while others face increased flooding. Understanding these regional variations is crucial for developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.",
